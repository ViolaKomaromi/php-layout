Based on what you know now, refactor the history page to take advantage of calc and CSS variables.

In general, look for situations where you are using variables to assist CSS declarations where the values are changing in the media queries, rather than redeclaring styles.

Situations where you are declaring a global variable (like a color or a size) that is used over and over, but does not change in media queries, is better suited to Sass.

Jen's end example is not comprehensive -- this is an example of a few places where you could use CSS variables in this example.

Hint: If you don't know where to start, think about navigation as something that changes across media queries. The wrapper class is another example.
